**Curation of sequence metadata**
	Every MarFERReT receives an [NCBI Taxonomy](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/taxonomy) identifier (taxID) through inheritance of a taxID from the source metadata or manual assignment of a taxID, if not existing assignment was available. All entries were manually updated if necessary to reflect changes and additions to the NCBI Taxonomy database, as of October 11th, 2022.
 

[NCBI Taxonomy](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/taxonomy) classification and nomenclature tables are gathered for MarFERReT entry taxIDs using the [‘taxtastic’ v0.9.2 software package](https://github.com/fhcrc/taxtastic).
