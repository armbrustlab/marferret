### Combining MarFERReT with other large reference sequence libraries

MarFERReT can be combined with other domain-focused reference sequence libraries or new reference sequence transcriptomes and genomes to expand taxonomic coverage. In this example, we combine MarFERReT with a filtered version of the prokaryote-focused MARMICRODB library. Both libraries use NCBI Taxonomy identifiers as their primary classification framework, facilitating compatible annotation approaches. After downloading or building the MarFERReT protein sequence database, bacterial sequences can be downloaded from the MARMICRODB Zenodo repository and the libaries concatenated together for use in downstream processes. 

Code for processing, cleaning and combining MARMICRODB with MarFERReT are here:
